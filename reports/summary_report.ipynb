    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer is a significant public health problem in todayâ€™s society. It is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics. The early diagnosis can improve the prognosis and chance of survival, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Furthermore, accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of breast cancer and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Many researchers use machine learning (ML) as the methodology to predict breast cancer pattern classification and forecast modelling. Classification and data mining methods are an effective way to classify breast cancer data. "

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used is publicly available and was created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, physician at the University Of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison, Wisconsin, USA. To create the dataset Dr. Wolberg used fluid samples, taken from patients with solid breast masses and an easy-to-use graphical computer program, which is capable for analysis of cytological features. The program uses a curve-fitting algorithm, to compute ten features from each one of the cells in the sample, than it calculates the mean value, extreme value and standard error of each feature for the image, returning a 30 real-valuated vector.\n",

    "\n",
    "I will explore and visualize the dataset using exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques. \n",
    "Use SciKit-Learn library in Python to split the data into training and testing data. Also use Classification algorithm of supervised learning, since the dataset has outcome variable or dependent variable i.e Y having only two set of values, either M (Malign) or B(Benign). To check the accuracy we need to import confusion_matrix method of metrics class. The confusion matrix is a way of tabulating the number of mis-classifications, i.e., the number of predicted classes which ended up in a wrong classification bin based on the true classes. To prove both my hypothesis, I will be doing visual analysis through matplot.lib and seaborn. "

    "\n",
    "The model works well with simple classification but it starts over fitting with complex classification. Thus for later works I will work on keeping the model simple: reduce variance by taking into account fewer variables and parameters, thereby removing some of the noise in the training data. Use regularization techniques such as LASSO that penalize certain model parameters if they're likely to cause overfitting. \n",
